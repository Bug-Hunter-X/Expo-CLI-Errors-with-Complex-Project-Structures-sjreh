# Expo CLI Errors with Complex Project Structures

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo CLI where it fails to properly process projects with deeply nested or complex directory structures.  The issue manifests as vague error messages during the build or start process, often not directly indicating the problem's source.

This bug is particularly challenging because the root cause is not typically a specific code error but rather a limitation or issue in the CLI's file system traversal.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the errors generated by the Expo CLI.  The errors are likely to be general build errors with vague descriptions.

## Potential Solutions

While there's no single guaranteed fix, the following strategies may help mitigate this issue:

* **Simplify Directory Structure:** Refactor your project to have a flatter and less nested directory structure. This is often the most effective approach.
* **Check for Circular Dependencies:** If you have modules with circular dependencies, this can confuse the Expo CLI's module resolution system.
* **Update Expo CLI:** Ensure you are running the latest version of the Expo CLI, as bug fixes might address some of these issues.
* **Clean Build:** Run `expo prebuild` before `expo start` to ensure the build process starts with a clean state.
* **Check Asset Paths:** Double-check the paths to your project's assets (images, fonts, etc.) to ensure they're correctly referenced and accessible.
