This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has a complex or deeply nested directory structure.  It's not a specific code error but rather a failure of the CLI to properly traverse and process the project's file system.  The error message itself can vary, sometimes indicating issues with resolving modules or finding assets within the project.
