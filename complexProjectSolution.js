The primary solution is to simplify the project's directory structure.  If you have a deeply nested project, consider restructuring it to have a flatter hierarchy. This helps the Expo CLI navigate the project's files more easily.  For example:

**Instead of:**

```
src/
  components/
    ui/
      Button.js
    navigation/
      Stack.js
  utils/
    helpers.js
```

**Use:**

```
src/
  Button.js
  Stack.js
  helpers.js
```

If simplification is not possible, carefully review the project structure for circular dependencies or incorrect asset path definitions. These can confuse module resolution and asset loading, leading to the CLI failing to properly build the project.
